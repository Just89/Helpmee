General description: <br/>
This prototpye was made as a A facebook game for the housing market. Think of games like farmvile, cityvile, etc 
and games like simcity, sims, etc. When you combine these ideas get a facebook game where players can build their 
own village on the basis of houses in real sale. Furthermore, the player can continue to furnish the village 
with flora, shops, etc.

The innovation is that every time a house for sale is placed in the village an advertisement of that house get 
posted on that player his message board (wall), example: "Justian lutteke has just released a new row house bought 
for his village!". Unconsciously, players of the game start advertising for the seller of the house in real life
(they will have to give permission to do so when they decide to play the game).
